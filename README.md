# Go RethinkDB Todo List Example Application

This is an example application for [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com) using the [GoRethink](https://github.com/dancannon/gorethink) driver. The application is based on the todo app from [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com).

## Running

To run the code you should have RethinkDB installed with the database `todo` and the table `items`. You should then run the following command `go build && ./GoRethink_TodoDemo` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
